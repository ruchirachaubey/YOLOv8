This project leverages YOLOv8 to detect essential safety objects inside a synthetic space station environment (provided by Falcon Digital Twin). The aim is to enhance **equipment tracking**, **crew safety**, and **inventory management** in space missions.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

| Metric         | Validation Set | Test Set |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Precision      | 95.1%          | 76.0%    |
| Recall         | 86.6%          | 73.6%    |
| mAP@0.5        | 90.7%          | 71.2%    |
| mAP@0.5:0.95   | 78.4%          | 59.3%    |

‚û°Ô∏è **Current mAP on test set: 0.71**

> Given more time, I would further improve accuracy by increasing training epochs, tuning hyperparameters (e.g., optimizer, learning rate), and leveraging GPU resources for longer training.

## ‚ùå Failure Analysis & Correction Strategy

We performed detailed analysis on incorrect detections and categorized failures into:

1. **Wrong Class Prediction**
   - Predicted label ‚â† Ground truth label.
   - Fix: Improve class separation with more diverse synthetic data.

2. **Poor Box Location (Low IoU)**
   - Box is misaligned or loose.
   - Fix: Fine-tune with higher-resolution images and adjusted `mosaic`/`IoU` thresholds.

3. **Missing Detection**
   - No box predicted for ground truth object.
   - Fix: Retrain with `single_cls=False` and more balanced data.

‚úÖ **Failure images saved in `Failure analysis/` folder**

## üìà Improvement Techniques Tried

| Parameter   | Original | Improved |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| `epochs`    | 10       | 20       |
| `mosaic`    | 0.1      | 0.5      |
| `optimizer` | AdamW    | SGD (tried) |
| `lr0`       | 0.001    | 0.0005   |

‚û°Ô∏è Future: Resume training from `best.pt` (warm start) to save time.

## üõ† How to Use the Model

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('best.pt')
results = model.predict(source='your_image.jpg', save=True)
